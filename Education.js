               I took my undergraduate study in Canada, University of Waterloo. The main
               fields of the study are statistics and computer science, mainly covered 
               the topic of programming in different languages, like C/C++, Python, React/Javascript/CSS/HTML,
               R, SQL, Bash script, and some Linux commands. Also, Object-oriented-programming, data structure 
               and algorithm are covered. For the statistic area, most of statistical models are taught, 
               data analysis with machine learning tools are also covered, like tree, neural network, KNN,
               Naive Bayes, general linear model with link function. I am confident with what I have learned 
               at school and I am always happy/passion to learn something new to me (hope it is not something bad). 
               I will definitely consider to go further study like master and doctor degree if I have high 
               risk to become homeless with my undergraduate diploma.
